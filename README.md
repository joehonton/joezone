# joezone
*Just what I need, and nothing more.*

## About

A JavaScript Library for node.js-based projects with no npm-module dependencies. 

## Here's what I need:

1. Filename assembly: Assemble a filename from its path parts. Split it into its path parts.
2. POSIX file inspection: Does a file exists? Is it read-only? 
3. POSIX directory inspection: Does a directory exist? Create a directory. Append relative path parts. Convert a relative path to an absolute path.


## Testing
The joezone library has been tested using the [Bequiesce](http://bequiesce.com) test harness.
