*Just what I need, and nothing more.*

## About

A JavaScript Library for node.js-based projects with no npm-module dependencies. 

## Here's what I need:

Filename assembly: Assemble a filename from its path parts. Split it into its path parts.
POSIX file inspection: Does a file exists? Is it read-only? 
POSIX directory inspection: Does a directory exist? Create a directory. Append relative path parts. Convert a relative path to an absolute path.
